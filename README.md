# Methods in Language Sciences Summer School - Eye-tracking module

Lecturers: Dr. Esperanza Badaya, Mariia Baltais

Hi everyone! This is our GitHub repository for the Eye-tracking module of the 2025 edition of MILS (UGent). You can find most of the files here and in Ufora, except where said otherwise (e.g., databases for pre-processing exercises). If you have any issues accessing/downloading those files, please let Esperanza or Mariia know in class.

Note that on Day 4 (Thursday), you will practice with an eye-tracker. This session will take place in the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (Henri Dunantlaan 2).

## Lectures

Day 1: Introduction to eye-tracking: Why? What? How?

Day 2: The Visual World Paradigm: Design, linking hypothesis & pre-processing

Day 3: Reading: Paradigms, single sentence reading design, linking hypothesis & pre-processing

Day 4: Lab visits

Day 5: Data analysis & wrap-up

## How can we navigate this repository?

In contrast to Ufora, we have organised the materials here as a function of what they are (references/slides/scripts). Most of the materials are already available, but the slides for each day will be published the day before.

### Readings

In this folder, we have included additional literature (on the eye-tracking technique, VWP, reading, software manual) as complementary readings.

### Resources

In this folder, you can find a (non-comprehensive) list of links to different labs/researchers that in turn have compiled great lists of resources for experiments (e.g., normed stimuli, images)

### Slides

Here you can find the .qmd files used to create the slides. These slides are made on Quarto. We have used the clean template by Grant McDermott and Kyle Butts (see here) with a few edits. We recommend you download the .pdf files, unless you want to download all the dependencies (which are stored in the 'knitted-slides' folder).

## Pre-requisites

In this course, we will use DataViewer for data pre-processing. We will share the link for download with you on Day 1. On Day 5, we will show snippets of R code for data analysis: Therefore, we welcome you to also download R if you want to practice with some data. To install R, visit the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/). We also recommend you to install [RStudio](https://posit.co/).
