# Eye movements in reading

## Reading research in a nutshell

We have a wealth of **paradigms** to explore how individuals comprehend a piece of written text (from single words to multiple sentences, created stimuli or real texts), considering both **low-level processes** for word identification (e.g., lexical access) and **higher-level processes** for sentence and discourse comprehension (e.g., inferences).

## Reading is a skill

-   Reading is relatively new
    -   Homo Sapiens $\pm$ 300.000 BC
    -   Sumerian pictographic writing $\pm$ 3.300 BC
    -   Phoenician alphabetic language $\pm$ 2.000 BC
-   Exposure, practice, formal instruction
    -   We are good at it ($\pm$ 250 WPM; Brysbaert, 2019)
    -   Linked to academic achievement, late L2 acquisition

## History

-   Javal (1879)

    -   Reading is not smooth

-   Mid-70s: Technological advances

-   Rayner's work

    -   Clifton et al., 2016: "Eye movements in reading and information processing: Keith Rayner's 40 year legacy"

::: notes
In 1879, the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal used a mirror on one side of a page to observe eye movement in silent reading, and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements for which he coined the term saccades.

Keith Rayner (June 20, 1943 -- January 21, 2015) was a cognitive psychologist best known for pioneering modern eye-tracking methodology in reading and visual perception.
:::

## Some general facts

-   Most people are good at reading, but there are individual differences (e.g., reading proficiency, L1 vs. L2...)
-   There seems to be some immediacy[^1] when comprehending a text, but we also get ahead of ourselves
-   In contrast to spoken language, people can go back when they encounter a difficulty, and indeed they do

[^1]: Cf. linking hypothesis; serial vs. parallel processing debate.

## Eye movements in reading

Human Visual System (recap):

-   **Fovea**: highest visual acuity
-   **Parafovea**: still partial recognition of objects
-   **Periphery**: blurred image

**Fixations** vs. **saccades**: movements (saccades) that place objects on the fovea for processing (fixations).

## Eye movements in reading

How does this work in reading?

-   A priori: Our eyes move, so that objects (words?) are placed on the fovea and can be processed.

...but this is not exactly so.

## Eye movements in reading

![From Conklin et al., 2018](_images/_session3/perceptual_span_reading.JPG){fig-align="center" width="590"}

## Eye movements in reading

-   Fovea does not equate the perceptual span (= effective visual field)
-   Reading is asymmetric = asymmetric extraction of information
    -   Bias towards the direction of reading in the language
    -   English: 3-4[^2] letter spaces (1 degree of visual angle) to the left, 14-15 ls to the right

[^2]: Depends on print size, of course.

## Eye movements in reading

Fixations

-   Mean duration (silent reading in English): 200 - 250 ms
-   Lexical access initiated at about 100 ms (Sereno & Rayner, 2003)
-   Optimal Viewing Position
-   Most reading measures are based on fixation durations
-   Affected by word length, frequency, predictability, etc.

![Data from Mariia Baltais](_images/_session3/mariia_fix.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
The Optimal Viewing Position (OVP) effect shows that word identification is best when the eyes first fixate near the center of words. When words are presented for short durations, recognition performance is maximal when the viewing position is slightly left of the word center.
:::

## Eye movements in reading

Saccades

-   Saccadic supression
-   Saccadic latency (about 200 ms)
-   Mean size (silent reading in English): 7 to 9 letter spaces ($\pm$ 2 words before or after the fixated word)
    -   Size = distance travelled (amplitude)
-   Not analyzed except for backward saccades (regressions)

![Data from Mariia Baltais](_images/_session3/mariia_sac.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
Saccadic suppression is a visual phenomenon where the brain temporarily reduces sensitivity to visual input during rapid eye movements (saccades). This suppression helps prevent a blurred, unstable visual experience when the eyes rapidly move across a scene.

Saccadic latency (150-250 ms): time needed to program and launch a saccade. This latency period includes the time required for the brain to process visual information, make a decision about where to move the eyes next, and initiate the eye movement.
:::

## Eye movements in reading

Regressions

-   10-15% of the saccades are regressions to preceding areas
    -   To correct 'overshooting'
    -   Processing difficulty

![Data from Mariia Baltais](_images/_session3/mariia_sac.JPG){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Eye movements in reading

![](_images/_session3/skipping.JPG){fig-align="center"}

## Eye movements in reading

Skipping

-   70% of the words in a text are fixated
-   Content words are fixated 85% of the time, function words 35% of the time
-   Main predictor: word length; also predictability, frequency, etc.
    -   Parafoveal processing!
-   Due to 'overshooting' or processing ease

## Eye movements in reading

Blinking

-   Noise
    -   Cf. data pre-processing
-   Cognitive role (attention)?
    -   Cornelis et al. (2025): naturalistic reading
    -   More blinks at punctuation marks; less blinks if high word frequency and predictability ("time-out"?)

# Reading paradigms

## Reading paradigms

Differ in ecological validity.

-   Gaze-contigent paradigms: eye gaze determines changes in the text display
-   Reading of experimental stimuli
-   Reading of natural text

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Moving window paradigm (e.g., McConkie & Rayner, 1975)

-   IA[^3]: Mask everything that's not fixated.
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span (extraction and use of information).
-   IV: Size of the window.

[^3]: This paper was retracted due to some legal issues.

::: notes
By varying the size of the window and the type of mask (e.g., X's, visually similar or dissimilar characters) and comparing the reading times in the window and normal reading conditions, it is possible to define the size of the area from which a reader can efficiently extract and utilize information.

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Moving window paradigm (e.g., McConkie & Rayner, 1975)

{{< video _images/_session3/moving_window.mp4>}}

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Some other examples (see next slides for details).

-   Foveal mask (moving mask) paradigm: the reverse of moving window
-   Disappearing text paradigm
-   Fast priming paradigm
-   Boundary paradigm
-   etc.

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Foveal mask paradigm (e.g., Rayner & Bertera, 1979)

-   IA: Mask what's fixated.
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span.
-   IV: Size of the window.

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Foveal mask paradigm (e.g., Rayner & Bertera, 1979)

<br>

{{< video _images/_session3/foveal_mask.mp4>}}

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Disappearing text paradigm (e.g., Liversedge et al., 2004)

-   IA: Disappears after having been fixated for a certain time.
-   Shows: Parafoveal + foveal processing.
-   IV: Time to disappear.
    -   Amount of visual exposure necessary for word recognition.

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Disappearing text paradigm (e.g., Liversedge et al., 2004)

<br>

{{< video _images/_session3/disappearing_text_animation.mp4>}}

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Fast priming paradigm (e.g., Sereno & Rayner, 1992)

-   IA: First there is a prime in the target location. After the target location has been fixated for some time, the target word appears.
-   Shows: Priming effect (facilitation).
-   IV: Relationship prime and target.

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Fast priming paradigm (e.g., Sereno & Rayner, 1992)

<br>

{{< video _images/_session3/fast_priming_paradigm.mp4>}}

## Gaze-contigent paradigms

Boundary paradigm (e.g., Rayner, 1975)

-   Saccadic suppression.
-   IA: Masked and then changed to target word after the gaze crosses an invisible boundary.
-   Shows: Parafoveal processing and perceptual span.
    -   Preview effect (slowdown).
    -   Preview benefit when no mask in the control condition.
    -   Parafoveal-on-foveal effects (e.g., Drieghe, 2011).
-   IV: What information is extracted, e.g., visual similarity mask-target.

::: notes
The boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975) makes use of the saccadic suppression. Saccadic suppression means that during a saccade the intake of visual information is suspended and the reader is practically blind. If a change in the visual environment is made during a saccade or very soon after the eyes have landed (\< 6 ms after the end of a saccade, McConkie & Loschky, 2002), the reader does not become consciously aware of it. The target word ("sentence" in the example of Table 7.1) is initially masked with a character string ("somkasoc"), and when the reader's eyes cross an invisible boundary in the text, the mask is replaced with the actual target word.

If the reader has extracted information from the target word preview prior to its change to the correct form, one should observe increased fixation time on the target word, even though the reader is not consciously aware of this. The size of the slowdown in eye fixation time, i.e. the difference between normal condition in which no change was made and a change condition is called the preview effect.

The preview benefit is simply computed as the difference in fixation time between a full preview condition, in which the target word was presented normally, and the preview condition.

Another measure to assess parafoveal processing is the so-called parafoveal-on-foveal effect (Kennedy, 2000). It measures the extent to which parafoveally available information affects fixation time on the previous word (see review by Drieghe, 2011).

## Reading of natural text

GECO corpus (Cop et al., 2017)

![](_images/_session3/geco.JPG)

-   The Mysterious Affair At Styles by Agatha Christie (1920)

## Reading of natural text

Ecological validity but lack of control over text:

-   Data collection: participants' characteristics, matching samples
-   Analysis: mixed-effects models, control variables (already annotated in corpora)

# Linking hypothesis

## Linking hypothesis

Fixations, regressions, skipping -\> wide range of measures.

Reading (during a fixation) entails the use of visual, orthographic, phonological, and morphological information to:

-   Identify a word
-   Activate its lexical representation
-   Integrate with the preceding context
-   Predict what's next?

## Linking hypothesis

-   What we look at = what we are processing

-   For how long we look = how difficult it is to process

    -   Extends beyond linguistic processing (visual attention)

Just and Carpenter's (1980) eye-mind hypothesis:

-   The eye remains fixated on a word as long as the word is being processed

Just and Carpenter's (1980) immediacy hypothesis:

-   Readers try to interpret each content word as soon as it is encountered

::: notes
From J&C:

Gaze durations reflect the time to execute comprehension processes. Longer fixations are attributed to longer processing caused by the word's infrequency and its thematic importance.

The model of reading comprehension proposes that readers interpret a word while they are fixating it, and they continue to fixate it until they have processed it as far as they can.

The link between eye fixation data and the theory rests on two assumptions. One is the eye-mind assumption: **the eye remains fixated on a word as long as the word is being processed**. The eye-mind assumption posits that there is no appreciable lag between what is being fixated and what is being processed.

The immediacy assumption: a reader tries to interpret each content word of a text as it is encountered, even at the expense of making guesses that sometimes turn out to be wrong. The immediacy assumption posits that the interpretations at all levels of processing are not deferred; they occur as soon as possible.

The immediacy assumption posits that an attempt to relate each content word to its referent occurs as soon as possible. Sometimes this can be done when the word is first fixated, but sometimes more information is required. For example, although the semantic interpretation of a relative adjective like large can be computed immediately, the extensive meaning depends on the word it modifies (e.g., large insect vs. large building). The referent of the entire noun phrase can be computed only after both words are processed. The immediacy assumption does not state that the relating is done immediately on each content word, but rather that it occurs as soon as possible.
:::

## Linking hypothesis

The more difficult the text...

-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the fixation durations
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the saccade sizes
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the regressions
-   The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the skipping of words

## Linking hypothesis

The more difficult the text...

-   The longer the fixation durations
-   The smaller the saccade sizes
-   The more frequent the regressions
-   The less frequent the skipping of words

## Linking hypothesis

-   "Strong" eye-mind hypothesis: readers fixate a word until it's processed as far as possible (how far?)

    -   Morrison, 1984: completion of lexical access on word *n* -\> immediate shift in attention & planning a saccade to word *n+1*

    -   Boland, 2004: the eyes do not leave a word until it has been *structurally* integrated

::: notes
Boland, 2004: The eyes do not leave a word until it has been structurally integrated. Therefore, **constraints that control structure-building influence first-pass reading time**.
:::

## Linking hypothesis

Too strong?

-   Pickering et al. (2004): some aspects of processing take more time than the eye is "prepared to wait"

    -   Semantic processing: "A lot of Americans protested during Finland."

-   Mitchell et al. (2008): regressions are not only linguistically supervised ('time-out' to postpone new input)

::: notes
Pickering et al. (2004): some aspects of lexical, syntactic, and semantic processing do (largely) respect the immediacy and eye-mind assumptions (with some important caveats), but that **many aspects of sentence interpretation are somewhat delayed**. Semantic processing may not all occur "at once" (readers do look at difficult words such as Finland - in "A lot of Americans protested during Finland", - but they largely do this during later processing rather than during first pass).

Mitchell et al. (2008): the purpose of regressive fixations (and, indeed, re-fixations on the same word) is not to refresh the evidence but merely a delaying tactic used to provide "time out" for as-yet-incomplete parsing operations (to postpone new input). Linguistic and other forms of eye-movement control are rather loosely-, not tightly-coupled.
:::

## Linking hypothesis

Asymmetrical perceptual span:

-   **Preview benefit**: some info about *n+1* while still on *n* -\> shorter reading times *n+1*
    -   Lexical processing can start before a word is fixated
-   **Parafoveal-on-foveal effects**: characteristics of *n+1* influence reading times for *n*
    -   Mixed findings, see Table 4.1 in Conklin et al., 2018 (p. 83)

## Linking hypothesis

As well as:

-   **Spillover effects**: characteristics of *n* influence reading times for *n+1*
    -   Processing has not been completed

Therefore,

-   Serial vs. parallel processing debate

    -   Different models of reading (E-Z Reader vs. SWIFT; OB1-Reader)

    -   Mlinarič et al. (2025): ± three words in parallel

::: notes
Serial: words are processed one at a time in a linear sequence. E-Z: eee-zee (easy).

Parallel: words are processed simultaneously. The cognitive system processes information from several words at once, allowing for faster and more efficient reading. Attention is distributed dynamically across several words, with a gradient of attention decreasing from the point of fixation outward. SWIFT: Saccade-Generation with Inhibition by Foveal Targets. The word currently fixated (the foveal target) inhibits the generation of saccades. This inhibition ensures that the word is sufficiently processed before the eyes move to the next word. Once a threshold of processing is reached, the inhibition decreases, allowing for the initiation of the next saccade. The SWIFT model emphasizes parallel processing and dynamic attention distribution, while the E-Z Reader model focuses on serial processing with some degree of parafoveal preview.

The OB1-Reader model (upgrade of E-Z?) incorporates both serial and parallel processing components: Optimal Viewing Position-Based Reading.

Mlinarič et al. (2025): ± three words in parallel, which is more than what some theories (e.g., E-Z Reader, Chinese Reading Model) suggest, but less than what some other theories (e.g., Glenmore, OB1-reader) suggest.

# Reading measures

## Reading measures

Fixations, regressions, and skipping form multiple reading measures that arguably tap into different cognitive processes.

-   **Global** vs. **local** measures
    -   Overall reading behaviour vs. smaller units of text
-   Local measures: **early** (vs. **intermediate**) vs. **late** (see also Clifton et al., 2007)

## Reading measures

Reading measures \<-\> specific cognitive events?

No agreement on **linking**: it depends on researchers' theoretical assumptions (Boland, 2004).

Traditionally,

-   **Early measures**: highly automatic word *recognition* and lexical access processes
-   **Late measures**: more conscious, controlled, strategic processes, such as syntactic and semantic *integration*

::: aside
Different types of linguistic manipulations (e.g., lexical vs. syntactic) can produce effects in the same measure --\> report both early and late measures.
:::

## Early measures

First-pass measures (before moving to *n+1*).

::: {r-stack}
![](_images/_session3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   **First fixation duration** (ms)
-   **Single fixation duration** (ms)
-   **Gaze duration** (= first-pass reading time = first-run dwell time): time on *n* before leaving it in either direction
-   **Skipping rate**: % trials where the IA was skipped on first pass
-   Influenced by length, frequency, predictability, etc.

::: notes
From Clifton et al., 2007. Skipping: length, predictability. FFD: earliest point to observe an effect due to properties of a word, e.g., frequency. GD: sensitive to semantic and syntactic anomalies.
:::

## Early measures

First-pass measures (before moving to *n+1*).

::: {r-stack}
![](_images/_session3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   First fixation duration: 3
-   Single fixation duration: NA (two first-pass fix)
-   Gaze duration: 3+4
-   Skipping: no (IA wasn't skipped in this trial)

## Intermediate measures

::: {r-stack}
![](_images/_session3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   **Regression-path duration** (= go-past time): time on *n*, *n-1*, etc., before moving to *n+1*
-   **(First-pass) regressions-out rate**: % trials where there was a regression out of the IA
-   Lexical and integration difficulties

::: notes
From Clifton et al., 2007. RPD: lexical and integration difficulties. Regr-out: difficulties in higher-level processing (e.g., discourse processing) of a text.
:::

## Intermediate measures

::: {r-stack}
![](_images/_session3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   Regression-path duration: 3+4+5+6
-   First-pass regressions-out: yes (between fix 4 and 5)

## Late measures

::: {r-stack}
![](_images/_session3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   **Re-reading time, second-pass reading time**: different definitions across literature
-   **Regressions-in rate**: % trials where there was a regression back into the IA
    -   Re-analysis, integration difficulties
-   **Total reading time** (= dwell time): sum of all fixations
-   **Fixation count**
    -   Could be early and/or late processing effects

::: notes
Re-reading time (= regression-path duration - gaze duration). Second-pass reading time (= total reading time - gaze duration).

From Clifton et al., 2007. Re-reading time (RPD-GD): indication of the time spent resolving a problem. TRT: impacted by both early and late processing. Effect in TRT but not in early measures -\> late effect on processing.
:::

## Late measures

::: {r-stack}
![](_images/_session3/earlymeasures.jpg){fig-align="center" width="900"}
:::

-   Re-reading time (= regression-path duration - gaze duration): 5+6
-   Second-pass reading time (= total reading time - gaze duration): 6+9
-   Regressions-in: yes (between fix 8 and 9)
-   Total reading time: 3+4+6+9
-   Fixation count: four fix

## Reading measures

Measures are dependent on each other:

-   First fixation duration $\subseteq$ gaze duration $\subseteq$ total reading time, etc.
-   Late measures are cumulative
-   No transparent mapping of measures to cognitive events!

Therefore,

-   An effect must be visible in \> 1 measure (rule of thumb)
-   Analysis: correction for multiple comparisons (Type I error)
    -   cf. von der Malsburg & Angele (2017)

But: the more precise your hypotheses, the better! (fewer comparisons, cf. von der Malsburg & Angele, 2017)

# Examples and confounds

## Sentence reading experiment

Elements:

-   Text (e.g., a sentence)
-   Optional task (e.g., a comprehension question)

Trial sequence: Drift correction -\> Visual presentation.

## Drift correction

Where the first character appears:

![](_images/_session3/drift_reading.jpg){fig-align="center" width="400"}

## Visual presentation

-   Time window of interest is from start to end (no triggers in between)
    -   Cf. gaze-contingent paradigms

Instead, Interest Areas:

![Data from Mariia Baltais](_images/_session3/ia_reading.png)

## Interest Areas

-   Target region *n* but also
    -   Pre-target region *n-1*
    -   Post-target (spillover) region *n+1*

Size depends on the research question:

-   Single words, phrases, entire clauses...

## Interest Areas

-   Vertically large enough
    -   Pre-processing: vertical drift correction

![Data from Mariia Baltais](_images/_session3/mariia_verticaldrift.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Task

-   Move to the next trial (button press)

    -   Consider handedness (e.g, turn the button box over)

    -   Useful trick: before pressing, look at the right lower corner of the monitor (e.g., a sticker)

-   Comprehension questions

    -   Every now and then / half of the trials / every trial...

## Confounds

-   Non-linguistic
    -   Visual presentation, eye-tracker specifics, human visual system
-   Linguistic
    -   Characteristics of the materials

## Non-linguistic confounds

Text layout:

-   Font style and size
    -   B&W is not recommended for dyslexic participants
    -   Monospace font (e.g., Courier)
    -   14-18 pt[^4] (3 letters = 1 degree)
-   Margins
    -   Tracking less accurate at screen borders

[^4]: Depends on the distance to monitor.

::: notes
Conklin et al., 2018: a study with dyslexic participants might use pastel colours for the background to help reduce contrast levels.
:::

## Non-linguistic confounds

Target (& spillover) IA:

-   Never beginning/end of the line
    -   1$^{st}$ word likely to be under-/overshoot or skipped
    -   1$^{st}$ and last fixations on a line are 5-7 ls from the edges
    -   1$^{st}$ fix longer, last fix shorter
-   Never clause-final
    -   Wrap-up effect

::: notes
Conklin et al., 2018: Aside from the problem of sentence wrap-up effects, fixations are not always stable when readers move from one line to the next, and often there is a tendency to under- or overshoot the target (the first word of the next line). Minor corrective saccades would influence reading times.
:::

## Non-linguistic confounds

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Line spacing[^5]
    -   Tracking less accurate for vertical movements (vertical drift)
    -   Double/triple spacing
:::

<br>

:::
:::

[^5]: Less important for global measures (sentence-level processing).

## Linguistic confounds

See Clifton et al., 2016; Conklin et al., 2018 (Ch. 4):

-   **The Big Three** (Frequency, Length, Predictability)

As well as...

-   Familiarity, plausibility, prevalence, age of acquisition, lexical ambiguity, orthographic neighbourhood size, etc.

::: notes
Plausibility (real world knowledge). Prevalence (word knowledge in the population). Lexical ambiguity (number of word meanings). Orthographic neighbourhood size (neighbours differ by 1 letter).
:::

## Linguistic confounds

Foveal vs. parafoveal processing:

-   Sequential nature of reading.

-   Information from one area can influence eye movements in another area.

Match contexts!

-   Predictability, length, etc.
-   Serial vs. parallel processing:
    -   Preview benefit, parafoveal-on-foveal effects (see Drieghe, 2011; Hyönä, 2011)
    -   Spillover effects

## Example: Juhasz & Sheridan (2020)

"The time course of age-of-acquisition effects on eye movements during reading: Evidence from survival analyses"

Background:

-   AoA effect: faster processing for words that are learned earlier in life.
-   Network plasticity hypothesis: early learned items are encoded more effectively -\> AoA influences multiple aspects of lexical processing, including orthography, phonology, and semantics.
-   Alternatively, AoA effect is limited to semantic processing.

RQ: Does AoA influence the earliest stages of word recognition during reading?

## Example: Juhasz & Sheridan (2020)

Linking hypothesis: E-Z Reader model

-   Lexical processing is serial
-   Direct lexical control over eye movements
-   Two stages: 1) orthography, phonology, familiarity (-\> saccade planning), 2) semantics (-\> shift in attention)

*Which reading measures are of most interest?*

## Example: Juhasz & Sheridan (2020)

Lexical access -\> early measures.

-   First fixation duration (!), single fixation duration, gaze duration
-   Skipping rate
-   Total reading time

Plus a time-course analysis to estimate the earliest divergence point.

## Example: Juhasz & Sheridan (2020)

Early vs. late AoA:

Julia will go to the mall to buy a new **skirt** when she gets out of work.

Julia will go to the mall to buy a new **shawl** when she gets out of work.

*Which potential confounds can you think of?*

## Example: Juhasz & Sheridan (2020)

Julia will go to the mall to buy a new **skirt** when she gets out of work.

Julia will go to the mall to buy a new **shawl** when she gets out of work.

-   Same context through at least the post-target word
-   Target word never the first or last two words

::: notes
Existing databases and norming studies.
:::

## Example: Juhasz & Sheridan (2020)

Finding:

-   AoA effects were observed in both early (at 158 ms) and late fixation duration measures.

*What did we learn about lexical processing in reading?*

## Example: Juhasz & Sheridan (2020)

-   Word properties can directly influence fixation durations from early on
-   AoA affects multiple measures (-\> multiple loci within the mental lexicon)
-   Consistent with SWIFT, too (lexical processing difficulty inhibits saccade programming)
-   Match contexts!

## Example: Howard et al. (2017)

"Processing of Co-Reference in Autism Spectrum Disorder"

Background:

-   Typicality effect: longer reading times for a category noun ("bird") when preceded by an atypical exemplar ("penguin")
-   ASD: reduced accuracy for reading comprehension and inferencing tasks (e.g., anaphor -\> antecedent)

RQ: Are individuals with ASD less efficient when computing co-referential links during reading?

*Which reading measures are of most interest?*

## Example: Howard et al. (2017)

Comprehension -\> global measures:

-   Mean fixation duration
-   Fixation count
-   Total reading time

Inferencing -\> target word ("bird"):

-   First fixation duration
-   Single fixation duration
-   Gaze duration
-   Total reading time

## Example: Howard et al. (2017)

The instruction booklet said that Tom would need a *hammer/plunger* to fix the kitchen sink. He borrowed the **tool** from his next door neighbour.

*How would you define the IAs?*

## Example: Howard et al. (2017)

![](_images/_session3/ias_howard.png){fig-align="center"}

*Which potential confounds can you think of?*

## Example: Howard et al. (2017)

-   Target words & contexts are identical across conditions
-   Two lines, target in the middle of the second line
-   Norming study for typicality
-   Individual differences!

![](_images/_session3/indvar_howard.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Plunger: to unclog the WC.
:::

## Example: Howard et al. (2017)

Finding:

-   No group differences (except for more re-reading in ASD)
-   ASD difficulties in reading comprehension are unlikely to be accounted for by differences in co-reference processing
-   Effects of verbal proficiency (expressive language score) across groups

*What to consider when building your own experiment?*

-   [Export data for analysis]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}
-   Visualization
-   Data wrangling
-   Analysis

## Data pre-processing

1.  Import data into software
    -   Time window (= Interest period)
2.  Assess data
    -   (Manual) checks
3.  (Automatized) cleaning
4.  Prepare data for analysis & export
    -   Interest Area report

# Reading pipeline

## Viewing session

For now, we'll look at the data that's already imported ('SingleLine_view.evs').

.edf = Eyelink Data File

.evs = Eyelink Viewing Session

## Check data

Trial-by-trial check.

More time-consuming than VWP but more conventional.

-   Drift (vertical, horizontal)
-   Blinks
-   Unusual behaviours

## Check data

Horizontal drift

-   Safest -\> exclude such trials.
-   Especially when you are unsure which IAs certain fixations belong to.
-   **Never** move fixations to the left or right.

![](_images/_session3/mariia_horizdrift.png){fig-align="center"}

## Check data

Vertical drift

-   Correct (move up/down) fixations that fall outside IAs
    -   Less work if top and bottom margins were big enough
-   To move certain fixations up/down: Windows Alt+*arrow*, Mac Option+*arrow*

![](_images/_session3/mariia_verticaldrift.png){fig-align="center"}

## Check data

Blinks in critical IA

-   Exclude trial? Optional
    -   Individual participants' behaviour -\> exclude participant?
    -   Happens randomly across conditions, and excluding those trials leads to overall large data loss -\> ignore?

![](_images/_session3/mariia_blink_target.png){fig-align="center"}

## Check data

Other

-   Participants were instructed to look at the corner when finished reading but went back to re-read
-   Remove those extra fixations

![](_images/_session3/sticker.png){fig-align="center"}

## Check data

Other

-   Started reading from the middle (critical IA)
-   Exclude trial

## Check data

Keep a detailed **log** of all changes!

![](_images/_session3/reading_cleaning_logbook.png){fig-align="center"}

## Automatized cleaning

What are we thinking of?

-   Extremely short and long fixations (outliers)
-   Fixations outside of IAs

Familiarity with previous literature is **key**.

Balanced loss across conditions.

## Automatized cleaning

Different thresholds -\> report *exactly* what you did.

-   Short outliers
    -   Merge short nearby fixations and remove those that couldn't be merged.
    -   Or just remove all fixations that are, e.g., \< 100 ms (Sereno & Rayner, 2003).
    -   Merging might inflate fixation measures, nor merging might inflate skipping if short critical IA.
-   Long outliers
    -   Remove all fixations that are, e.g., \> 800 ms.
-   Delete fixations outside IAs

## Automatized cleaning

Settings from Drieghe's lab (non-standard):

![](_images/_session3/4stage_b.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

<sup>Stage 1: merge fix shorter than 80 ms and less than 0.5 degrees away from each other. Stage 2: merge remaining fix shorter than 40 ms and less than 1.25 degrees away from each other. Finally (Stage 4), remove all remaining fixations that are shorter than 80 ms or longer than 800 ms. Also, remove all fixations that fall outside the IAs.</sup>

## Exporting data

Recap: Fixations and saccades **in several IAs** (*n-1, n, n+1*)

-   Interest Area report

![](_images/_session3/IAreport.png){fig-align="center"}

## Exporting data

-   Choose variables (or just export all)

![](_images/_session3/variables_report.png){fig-align="center"}

## Exporting data

We surely need participant ID (Session_Name\_), condition, item ID, and interest area ID (IA_ID). It could also be helpful to include IA_LABEL (text presented in the IA).

Let's choose some common measures:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Skipping
-   First fixation duration
-   Gaze duration
-   Regressions-in
-   First-pass regressions-out
-   Regression path duration
-   Total reading time
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](_images/_session3/var_choose.png)
:::
:::

## Output

Interest Area report

.txt → import in Excel and save as .xlsx or .csv

![](_images/_session3/IAreport_view.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Here all IAs are listed; for analysis, we look at each IA separately!

## Regions skipped on first pass

After we exported our Interest Area report and before starting the analysis:

-   In some trials, the region could have been skipped on first pass (IA_SKIP = 1).

-   This affects subsequent reading measures (first fixation? re-reading? etc.)

-   Therefore, we can report and analyze the skipping rate if we want;

-   For other measures, if IA_SKIP = 1, we will change the values to *NA* (label them as *missing values*) before we analyze them.

-   First-pass measures for sure: e.g., first fixation duration, gaze duration, first-pass regressions-out, regression-path duration.

## Regions skipped completely

If IA_SKIP = 1, but we don't want to just assign *NA* to all measures indiscriminately:

-   Later measures (e.g., regressions-in, total reading time): we can assign *NA* if the region was skipped completely (i.e., if IA_DWELL_TIME = 0).

    -   For regressions-in it's already the default;

    -   For total reading time the default is 0. Why would we want *NA* instead of 0? It might be better for statistical analysis (certain models don't deal well with zero values).

## Exercise

*What technical information do we expect to find (and where)?*

## Exercise

Puebla & Felser (2022)

![](_images/_session3/puebla.png){fig-align="center"}

## What to report?

Data preparation:

-   Vertical drift correction (% corrected fixations)
-   Thresholds for removing short and long fixations, merging, fixations outside IAs (% data loss)
-   Other reasons for data exclusion, e.g., horizontal drift, track loss, removal of individual fixations (% data loss)
-   Skipping in first-pass? (% data loss)
-   Blinks? (% data loss)

## What to report?

Dunn et al. (2024). Minimal reporting guideline for research involving eye tracking (2023 edition).

Jakobi et al. (2024). Reporting eye-tracking data quality: Towards a new standard.

## Take-home messages

-   Coding your experiment efficiently (e.g., meaningful variable names) saves you some time during pre-processing and data wrangling.
-   Eye-tracking data consists of time-stamped eye movement events and messages.
-   Software like Data Viewer make it easy to export what we are interested in.
-   Reading: important to decide on cleaning criteria beforehand and report them. Remember that pre-processing (trial-by-trial check) might take time.

## Practice time

Open DataViewer and import data files from 'SingleLine_deploy' to create your own viewing session.

Go through 'DB1' and 'DB2' and make changes as you see fit (don't forget to log them!). Afterwards we'll compare our solutions.
